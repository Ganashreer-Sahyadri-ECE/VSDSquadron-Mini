## Verilog Code Summary
- The module generates a signal using an internal clock (SB_HFOSC).
- The top module controls an RGB LED using internal logic.
- It uses an internal oscillator (SB_HFOSC) to create a clock.
- A counter is used to slow the frequency.
- LED output colors are toggled based on counter bits.
- The red, green, and blue LEDs are driven by various parts of a counter that grows with each clock cycle, causing them to blink. 
- testwire is used to check/debug signal behavior.
