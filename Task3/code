The uart_tx_8n1 module transmits 8-bit data over UART with 1 start bit, 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit.

It takes clk, txbyte, and senddata as inputs, and outputs tx (serial data) and txdone (transmission completion).

A state machine controls the process, moving through IDLE, STARTTX, TXING, and TXDONE states.

It sends the start bit, then serially transmits data bits, shifting the byte out bit by bit.

After the data, it sends a stop bit and signals transmission completion with txdone.
