# Modules Used:
uart_rx: Receives serial data from outside (from PC serial terminal).

uart_tx: Sends serial data back to the PC.

uart_loopback_top (Top module): Connects uart_rx and uart_tx together.


# Inside uart_loopback_top.v:
Inputs:
clk — System clock (for timing).

rst_n — Reset signal (active low).

rx_i — Incoming serial data from PC (receiver input).


# Outputs:
tx_o — Outgoing serial data to PC (transmitter output).

The uart_rx module receives the serial data and converts it into parallel 8-bit data.

When receiving is done, it raises a signal (let’s call it rx_done_tick) saying "Hey! I got a byte!".

The top module immediately passes that received byte (rx_dout) to the uart_tx module to transmit back.

The uart_tx module then sends that byte back to the PC through tx_o
