# Task 1: Verilog Code Deployment on VSDSquadron FPGA Mini Board
### ðŸŽ¯ Objective
This task focuses on comprehending and implementing Verilog code onto the VSDSquadron FPGA Mini Board. Key activities involve reviewing Verilog modules, defining pin constraints via a PCF (Physical Constraint File), and uploading the design to the board as per the datasheet specifications.

### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Verilog Code Analysis
The given Verilog module utilizes an internal oscillator (SB_HFOSC) to drive logic that controls an onboard RGB LED. A frequency divider (counter) is included to make the clock usable for human-observable LED blinking.

SB_HFOSC: Generates a clock internally without needing an external signal.

Counter: 28-bit register counts on each clock tick, with one bit (bit 5) exposed through testwire for signal probing.

RGB Driver (SB_RGBA_DRV): Drives the onboard LED. Blue is active; red and green are inactive.
This setup offers a minimal design for onboard LED control and timing verification using the FPGAâ€™s internal resources.

### ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Creating a Pin Constraint File
Mapped Verilog signals to the FPGA hardware pins as follows:

[pin mapping](./Task%201/pin%20mapping)

led_red â†’ Pin 39

led_blue â†’ Pin 40

led_green â†’ Pin 41

hw_clk â†’ Pin 20

testwire â†’ Pin 17
This ensures proper signal-routing between the FPGA logic and the physical I/O.

### ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Deployment to FPGA
After referencing the datasheet and finalizing PCF mappings, the board was connected via USB-C. Using terminal commands:

make clean was used to clear prior builds

make build compiled the Verilog source

sudo make flash uploaded the design
The onboard LED behavior confirmed a successful upload.

### ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Final Steps
A video was captured demonstrating the blinking LED behavior to verify the systemâ€™s functioning.

# Task 2: UART Loopback Implementation
ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Develop a simple UART echo mechanism to test UART transmission and reception by looping back the sent data.

### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Code Review
The project contains three modulesâ€”uart_rx, uart_tx, and uart_loopback_top.

uart_rx: Receives serial input from the PC and converts it into 8-bit data.

uart_tx: Sends the same data back.

uart_loopback_top: Connects both for an echo test.
This setup allows basic testing of UART in 8N1 format (8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit).
