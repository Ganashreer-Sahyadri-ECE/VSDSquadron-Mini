# Task 1: Understanding and Implementing the Verilog Code on FM

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Implement Verilog code on the VSDSquadron FPGA Mini Board, including code review, PCF file creation, and hardware integration.

### Step 1: Understanding the Verilog Code
This task involves analyzing the Verilog design, mapping pins, and flashing the code to the VSDSquadron FPGA Mini board.

### Verilog Code Summary:

Uses internal oscillator (SB_HFOSC).

Counter drives RGB LED.

testwire used for debugging.

Internal Module Breakdown:

SB_HFOSC: Generates internal clock.

28-bit counter: Slows down frequency.

SB_RGBA_DRV: Drives RGB LED (only blue is on).

### Step 2: Creating the PCF File

Pin Mapping:

led_red: Pin 39

led_blue: Pin 40

led_green: Pin 41

hw_clk: Pin 20

testwire: Pin 17

### Step 3: Hardware Integration

Read the datasheet.

Mapped signals to pins in PCF file.

Used USB-C to connect board.

Ran make clean, make build, and sudo make flash.

Verified LED behavior.

### Step 4: Final Documentation

[Working vedio.mp4](./Task%201/Working%20vedio.mp4)

LED blinks as expected.
